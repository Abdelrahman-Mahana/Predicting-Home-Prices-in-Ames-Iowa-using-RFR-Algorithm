# Predicting-Home-Prices-in-Ames-Iowa-using-RFR-Algorithm

This is a machine learning project that predicts the sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The Random Forest Regression algorithm is used to train a model on a dataset containing 79 features describing various aspects of the homes. The project goes through the process of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve a low root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.141.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
To install these libraries, you can use pip. For example:
          pip install pandas


## Usage

The main script is house-prices-prediction.ipynb. You can run this script in a Jupyter Notebook environment, such as Anaconda, or in a Google Colab notebook.

The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step in the machine learning pipeline, including:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Prediction and evaluation
The final model is saved in the file rfr_model.pkl.
